I'm really interested in generative art, and I've created a good deal of it over the past few years. Most of the time I use [Processing](https://processing.org), which is an excellent and simple Java framework for creating quick visual sketches. It has a concise API and requires very little boilerplate code, so I find it easy to quickly iterate on ideas.  


Most of my Processing sketches are dumped in this git repo [benmash/gen-art](https://github.com/benmash/gen-art)
